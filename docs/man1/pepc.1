\fB\-\-cstate\-prewake\fR [{on,off}]
Enable or disable C\-state prewake (applicaple only to Intel CPU). When enabled, exit from C\-state will start prior next event. This is possible only if time of next event is known, for example in case of local APIC timers. This command
toggles MSR 0x1fc, bit 30. Use "on" or "off". C\-state prewake setting has package scope. By default this option applies to all packages. If you do not pass any argument to "\-\-cstate\-prewake", it will print the current values.

model\-specific register can be locked by the BIOS, in which case the package C\-state limit can only be read, but cannot be modified. Package C\-state limit setting has package scope. By default this option applies to all packages. If you
do not pass any argument to "\-\-pkg\-cstate\-limit", it will print the current values.

.TP
\fB\-\-c1\-demotion\fR [{on,off}]
Enable or disable C1 demotion (applicaple only to Intel CPU). Allow/disallow the CPU to demote C6/C7 requests to C1. Use "on" or "off". C1 demotion setting has CPU scope. By default this option applies to all CPUs. If you do not pass
any argument to "\-\-c1\-demotion", it will print the current values.

.TP
\fB\-\-c1\-undemotion\fR [{on,off}]
Enable or disable C1 undemotion (applicaple only to Intel CPU). Allow/disallow the CPU to un\-demote previously demoted requests back from C1 to C6/C7. Use "on" or "off". C1 undemotion setting has CPU scope. By default this option
applies to all CPUs. If you do not pass any argument to "\-\-c1\-undemotion", it will print the current values.

By default this command provides CPU (core) frequency (P\-state) information, but if this option is used, it will provide uncore frequency information instead. The uncore includes the interconnect between the cores, the shared cache, and
other resources shared between the cores. Uncore frequency is per\-package, therefore, the '\-\-cpus' and '\-\-cores' options should not be used with this option.

maximum effeciency frequency, base,hfm \- base frequency (HFM), max \- maximum supported frequency.

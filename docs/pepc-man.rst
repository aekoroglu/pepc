**--cstate-prewake** *[{on,off}]*
   Enable or disable C-state prewake (applicaple only to Intel CPU).
   When enabled, exit from C-state will start prior next event. This is
   possible only if time of next event is known, for example in case of
   local APIC timers. This command toggles MSR 0x1fc, bit 30. Use "on"
   or "off". C-state prewake setting has package scope. By default this
   option applies to all packages. If you do not pass any argument to
   "--cstate-prewake", it will print the current values.

**--c1e-autopromote** *[{on,off}]*
   Enable or disable C1E autopromote (applicaple only to Intel CPU).
   When enabled, the CPU automatically converts all C1 requests into C1E
   requests. This command toggles MSR 0x1fc, bit 1. Use "on" or "off".
   C1E autopromote setting has package scope. By default this option
   applies to all packages. If you do not pass any argument to

   package C-state the platform is allowed to enter. The package C-state
   limit is configured via MSR {hex(MSR_PKG_CST_CONFIG_CONTROL)}
   (MSR_PKG_CST_CONFIG_CONTROL). This model-specific register can be
   locked by the BIOS, in which case the package C-state limit can only
   be read, but cannot be modified. Package C-state limit setting has
   package scope. By default this option applies to all packages. If you
   do not pass any argument to "--pkg-cstate-limit", it will print the
   current values.

**--c1-demotion** *[{on,off}]*
   Enable or disable C1 demotion (applicaple only to Intel CPU).
   Allow/disallow the CPU to demote C6/C7 requests to C1. Use "on" or
   "off". C1 demotion setting has CPU scope. By default this option
   applies to all CPUs. If you do not pass any argument to
   "--c1-demotion", it will print the current values.

**--c1-undemotion** *[{on,off}]*
   Enable or disable C1 undemotion (applicaple only to Intel CPU).
   Allow/disallow the CPU to un-demote previously demoted requests back
   from C1 to C6/C7. Use "on" or "off". C1 undemotion setting has CPU
   scope. By default this option applies to all CPUs. If you do not pass
   any argument to "--c1-undemotion", it will print the current values.
